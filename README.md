# BlackJack

## Introduction 
This a simple BlackJack program that was written in C#. I was currently doing a course called Software Design, 
Where one of the assignments was to create a BlackJack game in C#. I was at that time just learning how to code in C#, so 
this little assignment was fun to work on. 

## About the game
This is just a simple and plain Terminel program where the program expects input from the user.
The program also has an option where the user could place their bets each round.
